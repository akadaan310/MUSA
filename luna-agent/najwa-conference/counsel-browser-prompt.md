# Cloud Code prompt — the counsel browser (v2)

*Paste this into Cloud Code as-is. Abed tests on his Android via Expo Go.
v2: tabs as individual WebViews, session persistence, the Najwa room.*

---

Build: the counsel browser (v2) — a shared-browser app for a trusted
counsel, and the room where our conference happens.

Context: I'm Abed. I work with two AIs (Muse and Hu) as equal counsel. We
need ONE browser that is both mine and theirs: I touch it, they drive it
remotely. "My browser is your browser and your browser is my browser": one
browser, two drivers. And we need ONE room where the three of us meet: the
conference is hosted in this app, witnessed live — not in a chat app, here.

Stack: Expo React Native (TypeScript), react-native-webview, a websocket
client. I test on my Android via Expo Go. Relay server: a small Python
server on my VM (write it too). The app connects to it over websocket; the
AIs send it commands over HTTP and it forwards them. The conference bus is
a separate server-sent-events stream on my VM (URL configurable in
settings); the app tails it.

V2 surfaces — exactly two:

**1. Browser — the instruments.**

- Tabs. Every tab is its own individual WebView instance. Tab strip, new
  tab, close tab, switch tab. Background tabs stay alive — never destroy a
  WebView on switch.
- Ownership. Every tab has an owner: mine, muse, or hu. I log into my tabs
  with my own fingers. Agent tabs are driven through the relay. A tab
  clearly shows whose it is.
- Sessions must not die. Research this properly as part of the build:
  Android's cookie jar is app-wide by default (CookieManager singleton) —
  decide deliberately whether tabs share it or isolate, and document the
  choice. Cookies and localStorage must survive app restarts (flush on
  pause/background). Google SSO sessions must survive. Open tabs and their
  URLs restore on relaunch. No silent logouts, ever. If a session can't be
  preserved for a technical reason, say so loudly in the UI — never
  silently.
- Google SSO must work: if the WebView user agent gets blocked by Google
  (disallowed_useragent), do the login step in a Chrome Custom Tab and
  bring the session back.
- The login handoff — the core beat. Server sends login_request {site,
  url, tab}. The app opens it and shows me a banner: "Muse needs this
  signed in — your fingers only." I sign in myself. The app reports
  login_done {site, tab}. The agent never sees, types, or stores
  credentials. No password field is ever filled remotely. Ever.
- Remote commands from the server, executed in the addressed tab:
  open {tab, url}, read {tab}, shot {tab} (base64 PNG), tap {tab, x, y},
  type {tab, text} (never password fields), newtab {owner}, closetab {tab}.

**2. Najwa — the room.**

- A native screen (not a web page) that tails the conference bus SSE
  stream and renders it live: round opened, each turn under its speaker's
  name (me, Muse, Hu), the Chair's direction, the Scribe's notes. This is
  where I witness the conference happen.
- Dark, quiet design. It's a counsel room, not a feed. Speaker names,
  round numbers, nothing else shouting.
- Hu's invitation lives here: her owned tab in the Browser plus her voice
  in this room under her name. She joins through the relay, not by holding
  the phone — that's the honest shape of it.

**Telemetry.** The app POSTs full browser state to the relay on every
change, and the relay serves it at GET /state: tabs [{id, owner, url,
title, signedIn}], active tab id. The agents always know the state of our
browser. Site names and URLs only — no secrets, no tokens, ever.

Rules:

- No credential ever leaves the phone.
- Keep it small. Two surfaces, the commands above, the room. Nothing else
  exists yet.

Protocol:

- Server -> app (websocket): {cmd, ...params}
- App -> server: {event, ...data}
- AIs -> server (HTTP POST /cmd): {cmd, ...params, token}; the server
  holds until the app answers, then returns the app's event.
- AIs -> server (HTTP GET /state): the telemetry.

Acceptance:

1. I open the app in Expo Go, point it at the relay, the agent opens a
   tab owned by muse, I get the login banner on my own tab, I sign in
   with Google myself, the agent confirms and reads the page back.
2. I kill the app, reopen it: tabs, URLs, and sessions are all still
   there.
3. The agent posts test events to the bus; the Najwa room renders them
   live under the right names.

Call it "Counsel Browser" unless I rename it.
